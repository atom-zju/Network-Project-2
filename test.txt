Test case configuration files and corresponding simulator outputs, differentiated by DV and LS, are 
included in the mytest directory.

We developed configurations to test our routing protocols, both at the component and system levels. 
We also added a shell script (test.sh) to automate the testing process for the numerous testing 
scenarios that we developed. Different configuration files test different aspects of our implementation, 
including corner cases and our ability to perform require tasks in multiple scenarios. We also used
the provided simple test cases to test simple packet transmission and routing calculation.

Test Strategy:
==============

Components test: we divided our whole system into 4 parts to test: set/handle alarms, send/receive/process packet, 
port table, and forwarding table.

1. set/handle alarms: We tested the set/handle alarm process at the very beginning of the project. First we tested 
if we can call the system call “set_alarm” correctly by putting a string into parameter. In “handle_alarm”, we printed 
the previously set string. After implementing all four types of alarm, we used simpletest1 to check if they 
run in a correct way.

2. send/receive/process packet: We tested this part after implementing actions for all packet types. We put some 
arbitrary contents into packets and after the packets is delivered and processed, those contents would be printed 
put immediately. Then we also hard-coded packets with designated content and used simpletest1 to test if the 
protocol behaved well after we implemented the port table.

3. port table: In port table, it needs to keep tracking and recording all neighbors’ ID, corresponding ports, 
delays, and timestamps. To ensure the algorithm and data structure act flawlessly, we implemented a method to print 
out the entire table and we run several test cases in gdb, printing whole table step by step. 

4. forwarding table: Same as port table. We also implemented a method to print out whole table. What’s more, for DV 
protocol, we developed 2 more test cases, 4NodesHomework.test, and 3NodesPoisonReverse.test, to test if the poison 
reverse was performing right. For LS protocol, we also run and analyzed all test cases to examine its correctness. 
Details about these cases will be shown below.

System test: after implemented all features of the system, we tested them as a whole system. We first executed 
three simpletest cases given by instructor, comparing results with the given outputs. After eliminating several 
minor bugs, we created a complex case, 15NodesComplex.test, to inspect the robustness of our system. Finally, we 
developed two corner-case tests, 3NodesLinkDead.test, and 4NodesDelayUpAndDown.test, to inspect if our protocols 
could handle such cases and switch to correct paths. Details about these cases will be shown below.

Test File Descriptions:
=======================

15NodesComplex.test - This scenario, first, tests our systems ability to handle larger amounts 
of nodes, in this case 15, that are largely interconnected with a complex topology with many 
different delay values. Many data packets are sent between nodes in order to ensure that the 
forwarding tables for all nodes have been correctly established for both DV and LS. The large 
number of nodes in conjunction with the complex topology tests our ability to route packets across
complex routes. The topology is then changed in our test by changing the delays of key links, and 
then with certain links failing, in order to test our system’s robustness in adapting to new routing
paths. The outputs for the DV and LS tests are in 15NodesComplex.test_DV.out and 15NodesComplex.test_LS.out,
respectively.

3NodesLinkDead.test - This scenario tests our system’s ability to adapt to link failures, and reconnections,
between nodes. In this test, our three nodes are connected by two links. Protocol packets (DV or LS depending
on the test protocol) and ping/pong messages are seen to be properly exchanged between the nodes prior to
link failure. Once the failure occurs, those interactions between the connected nodes continues as it should,
while the packets are lost trying to communicate with the disconnected node, as they should. Once the node
is reconnected later in the test, proper communication between all three nodes is restored. This shows 
our robustness in regards to link failures and reconnections. The outputs for the DV and LS tests are in
3NodesLinkDead.test_DV.out and 3NodesLinkDead.test_LS.out, respectively.

3NodesPoisonReverse.test - This test specifically tests a case brought up in class, the count to 
infinity problem, and if we properly use poison reverse to avoid that issue. We used this test to 
edit aspects of our DV protocol, and test the correctness of our LS protocol. We start with three 
interconnected nodes, and allow them to develop their forwarding tables, with one specific route heavily 
favored. We then change the delay of the favored path, making it no longer the preferred route for any 
node, to test our DV packet updating abilities and our poison reverse. The routers find this update, 
and adjust the forwarding tables accordingly. We send a data packet between nodes before and after 
the delay change to ensure that, indeed, the forwarding tables and packet route did change. The outputs
for the DV and LS tests are in 3NodesPoisonReverse.test_DV.out and 3NodesPoisonReverse.test_LS.out, 
respectively. 

4NodesDelayUpAndDown.test - This test concerns our routing abilities to find the best possible route, given
multiple routes in a router/link topology. In this test, we have four nodes connected by four links. We send the 
same data packet multiple times throughout the test in order to see, and confirm, the route chosen by the 
system is the correct path given the link delays. After the first transmission, the link delays change, testing 
our system’s ability to detect these changes and recalculate routing paths. This happens again after the second
transmission, with the delay value going down. We then test our system’s ability to respond to link failures, and 
to redirect packet routing over the still connected routes. The success of the packet routing can be seen through
the packet transmissions from the same origin to the same destination after each topology change and how the 
route in each case is chosen.

4NodesHomework.test - This test specifically addresses a case brought up in the homework, namely, the possibility 
of forming routing loops after the failure of a link. Given the four node graph from Homework #1, problem #6, we 
establish the proper routing tables, and then send a packet of information from a node to the node connected by only
a single link. We then have that link fail in order to test our ability to avoid a routing loop. As we desired, 
once the link fails, the still-connected nodes are updated to see that there is no path in which they can reach
the now disconnected node; we show this by attempting to send a packet from the connected nodes to this other node,
and see that the packets will be lost due to having no known path to the router, as expected. The outputs for the
DV and LS tests are in 4NodesHomework.test_DV.out and 4NodesHomework.test_LS.out, respectively. 

*.out – .out files are the out put files from each test cases. One test case should have 2 .out files, _DV.out and
_LS.out, which are corresponding to DV protocol and LS protocol.

test.sh – a shell script used to run all test files one by one.

simpletest1,2,3 and .desc - simple test cases given by instructor.
